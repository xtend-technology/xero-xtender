# Extending functionality of Xero Customers and bank transactions

This app provides additional features to Xero which we find useful. It uses oAuth2 to securely allow you to give permission for this app to retreive data from your Xero file and use it to provide additional features. Limited to 30 minutes per login.

# Customer interface
The customer interface allows you to:
- Print any or all invoices you have sent to customers with the click of a button
- Instantly see if a customer's info is missing details such as name or email. 

# Bank transactions
- Import spend or receive money transactions in bulk via csv. Handy if you have many items such as stripe fees which need to be added all at once.
