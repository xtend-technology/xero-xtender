             <p>This app extends the functionality of Xero. <br />The customer view gives an overall snapshot at a glace of info which may need updating and allows you to list and download 
                 all or any of a customer's invoices at the click of a button. <br />Bank transactions allows you to upload bank transactions in bulk using the template provided.<br/>Access is limited to 30 mins and you will be automatically logged out after this time. You can log back in any time.<br/>It is 
                 a work in progress and we hope to add functionality and improvements to layout and styling as we go.<br />Suggestions are always welcome and please reach out if you would like to collaborate on this or other projects.</p>
